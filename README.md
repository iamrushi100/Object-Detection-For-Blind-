# üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Object Detector for Blind People

**Object Detector for Blind People** is a Python-based tool designed to assist visually impaired individuals by detecting objects in their surroundings and providing audio feedback in real-time.

---

## üåü Features
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv5 for fast and accurate object recognition.  
- **Text-to-Speech Integration**: Announces detected objects to provide instant audio feedback.  
- **Customizable Object Classes**: Detect only the objects relevant to your needs (e.g., people, bottles, etc.).  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified design to ensure accessibility for all users.

## üí° Customization  

### Select Specific Object Classes  
You can customize the classes to be detected by modifying the `model.classes` variable in the script.  

**Example:**  
```python
model.classes = [0, 39]  # Detects 'person' and 'bottle'
```
### Adjust Text-to-Speech Settings

Modify the pyttsx3 parameters in the script to adjust the audio settings such as:
Volume
Speech Rate
Voice
